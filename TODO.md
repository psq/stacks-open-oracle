TODO

- deploy on mocknet
- deploy on mainnet on throwaway address
- deploy on mainnet on official address
- setup cron somewhere, every 5 minutes, but only broadcast if nonce has changed
- use RBF to get data closer to actual block?
- what about microblocks, there is not really any docs available on how to use with sdks...

DONE
